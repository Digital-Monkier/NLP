                the Judges...they've all sent gifts.

                investment?","                The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
                has contacts in Turkey for the
                poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
                process down to morphine or up to
                heroin.  Also he has access to this
                country.  He's coming to us for
                financial help, and some sort of
                immunity from the law.  For that we
                get a piece of the action, I
                couldn't find out how much.
                Sollozzo is vouched for by the
                Tattaglia family, and they may have
                a piece of the action.  They call
                Sollozzo the Turk.
                He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
                and is suppose to have a Turkish
                wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
                very quick with the knife, or was,
                when he was younger.  Only in
                matters of business and with some
                reasonable complaint.  Also he has
                an American wife and three children

                competent.","                Then eat your spaghetti and I'll

                United States.  He's known to the
                Government as a top narcotics man.
                That could be a plus for us; he
                could never get immunity to testify.","                Once upon a time, about fifteen
                years ago some people wanted to
                take over my father's olive oil
                business.  They had Al Capone send
                some men in from Chicago to kill my
                father, and they almost did."

                them.  He tied the two Capone men
                hand and foot, and stuffed small
                bath towels into their mouths.
                Then he took an ax, and chopped one
                man's feet off..."

                purely a business dispute: Get rid
                of Sollozzo, and everything falls
                in line.  YOU don't have to go
                after the Tattaglias.","                Then we can have dinner, see a

                contacts and personal influence,
                the Corleone family loses half its
                strength.  Without your father, the
                other New York families might wind
                up supporting Sollozzo, and the
                Tattaglias just to make sure there
                isn't a long destructive war.  The
                old days are over, this is 1946;
                nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If

                payphone across from the old man's
                building.  We got people in the

                families in New York.  The Tattaglia

                payroll, and for big money.
                McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
                bodyguard.  What you have to
                understand is that while Sollozzo
                is guarded like this, he's
                invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
                gunned down a New York Police

                happened; I could accept it, but
                that I never had a choice.  From
                the time I was born, you had laid
                this all out for me."

                interests in the Olive Oil business
                and settling here.  Moe Greene will
                sell us his interest so it can be

                appear five times a year for maybe
                a week long engagement.
                We hope your friends in the movies

,,"                Is my credit good enough to buy you
                out?"
,,"                The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
                family wants to buy you out."
,,"                Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
                can do better."

                Corleone family bankrolled your
                casino.  You and the Corleone
                family are evened out.  This is for

,,"                          (quietly, deadly)

                running the Family business now.
                So anything you have to say, say it
                to me."
,,"                Freddie, you're my older brother.

,,"                In six months you can break off
                from the Corleone Family and go on
                your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
                you to make the move to Nevada;
                you'll be my right-hand man out
                there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
                Consigliere."
,,"                He's going to be our lawyer in
                Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
                other business as of now, this
                minute.  No reflection on Tom;
                that's the way I want it.  Besides,
                if I ever need any advice, who's a
                better Consigliere than my father."
,,                Maybe less...
,,"                No.  I want things very calm for
                another six months."
,,"                All I can say is that things are
                being resolved that are more
                effective than a thousand buttonmen
                on the streets.  Understood?"
,,                I'll come to you when I need you.
,,"                All right, then it's resolved."
,,"                Tom, we're going to be legitimate
                all the way, and you're the legal
                man.  What could be more important
                than that."
,,                How did you find out?
,,                Not so perfectly if you noticed.
,,"                You're not a wartime Consigliere.
                Things may get tough with the move
                we're trying."
,,"                          (coldly)
                You're out, Tom."
,,                I'm going to talk to my father.
,,                I'll need him.
,,                How?
,,                Yes.
,,                I've always respected you...
,,                He talked to you?
,,"                          (softly)
                Christ, Tom; I needed more time
                with him.  I really needed him."
,,"                Not all...I needed another four
                months and I would have had them
                all.
                          (he looks at TOM)
                I guess you've figured it all out?"
,,"                I know now.
                          (a passion wells up
                          inside of MICHAEL)

                safe."
,,"                But after the Baptism.  I've
                decided to stand as godfather to
                Connie's baby."
,,"                Yes, I promise."
,,                I do renounce him.

,,"                Carlo...we've had a change in the
                plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
                kids will have to take the trip out
                to Vegas without us."

,,"                          (to KAY)

,,                You have to answer for Santino.
,,"                You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
                people.  That little farce you
                played out with my sister.  Did
                Barzini kid you that would fool a
                Corleone?"
,,"                          (quietly)
                Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
                Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
                and Moe Greene...I want to square
                all the family accounts tonight.
                So don't tell me you're innocent;
                admit what you did."
,,"                          (almost kindly)
                Don't be frightened.  Do you think
                I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
                think I'd make your children
                fatherless?  After all, I'm
                Godfather to your son.  No, your
                punishment is that you're out of
                the family business.  I'm putting
                you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
                you to stay there.  I'll send
                Connie an allowance, that's all.
                But don't keep saying you're
                innocent; it insults my intelligence
                and makes me angry.  Who approached
                you, Tattaglia or Barzini?"
,,"                          (softly)
                Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
                car waiting to take you to the
                airport."
,,"                I'll call your wife and tell her
                what flight you're on."
,,"                          (smiles)
                Speak your mind."
,,                No.  This I have to do.

,,                Where's the boss?
,,                Get her home and get a doctor.
